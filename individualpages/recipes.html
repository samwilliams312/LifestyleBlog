     <h1>Recipes</h1>
     
     <p>When cooking, I prefer to keep things simple. Using wholesome, fresh ingredients to create satisfying meals
          is my goal. I am far from being skilled in the kitchen - being accident prone and near flames and knives is
          a poor combonation. The recipes on my blog are health conscious, quick and easy to prepare.
