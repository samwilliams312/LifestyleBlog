     <h1>Exercises</h1>

     <p>Throughout my early adulthood it was easy to stay in shape and maintain a physique even when
          my diet was not the healthiest. Those days are far gone, and as a busy young woman I often 
          times find it difficult to find workouts that are both effective and (somewhat) enjoyable. I 
          will share my trials and tribulations, in hopes that you may take away some ammusement and workouts that
         fit into your schedule, so you can fit into those skinny jeans.
